# Point-to-point graph for football table data
A script that takes a 'wide' table of a football season and returns a point-to-point line graph.

How did Union Berlin - the German capital's "other" team - manage to make it into the Europa League while their rivals from the westside of town only just avoided relegation?

These point-to-point graphs show how much advantage Union got from playing at their "fan-built" stadium - even with barely anyone there.

In fact, no other team bar Eintracht Frankfurt had a more disproportionate home ground advantage.

**About**

Created using Plotly Express, with table data from Soccerway.com.

In this example, it looks at the final 2020-2021 Bundesliga season.

Four custome style functions have been built into the graph function: 'Default', 'Minimalist', 'Pastely', 'LightBlueBack'.
